## Project Overview

A smart educational platform that helps students discover the skills best suited to them and turn those skills into practical abilities that can generate real income.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to build a smart educational platform that helps students discover suitable skills based on their interests, strengths, and goals, and guides them through a structured learning path until they can apply these skills in real-world opportunities that may generate income.

Additional objectives include:

- Providing personalized skill recommendations
- Offering clear learning roadmaps with free resources
- Enabling students to track their progress

>
> - Complete an interest assessment
